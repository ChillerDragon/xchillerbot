# xchillerbot

This is a personal project for my self. It is open open source because I open source everything I can.
There is a very low chance anyone will find this useful! Look elsewhere!


You have been warned... here it goes. With the risk of rewriting https://github.com/nioc/xmpp-bot
this project is about sending xmpp notifications to my self. I plan to use this
to monitor things like game and linux server health. And send incident reports to my phone
which currently is iOS equipped with the xmpp monal client.

## setup

```
cp env.dist .env
vim .env

npm i
node index.js
```
